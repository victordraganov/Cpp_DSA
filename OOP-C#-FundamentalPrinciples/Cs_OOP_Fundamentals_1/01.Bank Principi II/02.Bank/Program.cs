//02.A bank holds different types of accounts for its customers: deposit accounts, loan accounts and mortgage accounts. Customers could be individuals
//   or companies. All accounts have customer, balance and interest rate (monthly based). Deposit accounts are allowed to deposit and with draw money.
//   Loan and mortgage accounts can only deposit money. All accounts can calculate their interest amount for a given period (in months). In the common
//   case its is calculated as follows: number_of_months * interest_rate.
